Adding a README
You're done building Chirpy! Great work!

I want to take a moment to cover how you should think about your public GitHub profile, and especially how it can help you in your job search.

We have a more in-depth course that includes building a professional GitHub profile, but for now, I want to cover some basics.

Do I Have to Put This on GitHub?
You really should. It doesn't necessarily need to be publicly visible, but it's good to keep copies of all of your code for future reference.

Projects Are Your Professional Portfolio
When you start looking for jobs, you're going to want a couple of great projects on your GitHub or GitLab profile that show off your skills.

This probably isn't one of those because you built it using a guide.

That said, it may be wise to treat this project like one and get your feet wet with the process of presenting a project to the world.

How to Present This Project
When someone navigates to your project's link, the first thing they'll see is the README.md file. You should quickly and concisely explain:

What your project does
Why someone should care
How to install and run your project
Take a look at one of my portfolio projects as an example: go-rabbitmq.

Good luck!
