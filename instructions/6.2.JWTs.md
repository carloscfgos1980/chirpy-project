1. Down the JWt library. In the server dictectory:
go get -u github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5

2. <internal/auth.go> Function to create JWT:
func MakeJWT(
 userID uuid.UUID,
 tokenSecret string,
 expiresIn time.Duration,
) (string, error)

3. <internal/auth.go> Function to validate JWT:

alidateJWT(tokenString, tokenSecret string) (uuid.UUID, error)

4. <internal/auth_test.go> Testing validate JWT functio:
func TestValidateJWT(t *testing.T)

5. run the tests:
cd internal/auth
go test -v

Authentication With JWTs
Let's take a closer look at how JWTs work in the authentication flow.

Step 1: Login
It would be pretty annoying if you had to enter your username and password every time you wanted to make a request to an API. Instead, after a user enters a username and password, our server should respond with a token (JWT) that's saved in the client's device.

The token remains valid until it expires, at which point the user will need to log in again.

Step 2: Using the Token
When the user wants to make a request to the API, they send the token along with the request in the HTTP headers. The server can then verify that the token is valid, which means the user is who they say they are.
