JWT Review
JWTs are cryptographically signed JSON objects that contain information about an authenticated user.

I've heard "JWT" pronounced as "jot", but I pronounce it "jay double yoo tee".
JWTs Can't Be Changed
We'll talk about MACs, HMACs, and digital signatures in a later course, which are the cryptographic concepts that power JWTs. For now, it's just important to know that once the token is created by a server, the data in the token can't be changed without the server being aware of it.

When your server issues a JWT to Bob, Bob can use that token to make requests as Bob to your API. Bob won't be able to change the token to make requests as Alice.

JWTs Are Not Encrypted
JWTs are not encrypted. Anyone who has the token can read the data (like the expiry and the user id) in the token. This is why you should never store sensitive information in a JWT. It's just a way to authenticate a user.

I like using JWT.io to inspect JWTs. It is a great tool for playing around with them and learning how they work.


Revoking JWTs
One of the main benefits of JWTs is that they're stateless. The server doesn't need to keep track of which users are logged in via JWT. The server just needs to issue a JWT to a user and the user can use that JWT to authenticate themselves. Statelessness is fast and scalable because your server doesn't need to consult a database to see if a user is currently logged in.

However, that same benefit poses a potential problem. JWTs can't be revoked. If a user's JWT is stolen, there's no easy way to stop the JWT from being used. JWTs are just a signed string of text.

The JWTs we've been using so far are more specifically access tokens. Access tokens are used to authenticate a user to a server, and they provide access to protected resources. Access tokens are:

Stateless
Short-lived (15m-24h)
Irrevocable
They must be short-lived because they can't be revoked. The shorter the lifespan, the more secure they are. Trouble is, this can create a poor user experience. We don't want users to have to log in every 15 minutes.

A Solution: Refresh Tokens
Refresh tokens don't provide access to resources directly, but they can be used to get new access tokens. Refresh tokens are much longer lived, and importantly, they can be revoked. They are:

Stateful
Long-lived (24h-60d)
Revocable
Now we get the best of both worlds! Our endpoints and servers that provide access to protected resources can use access tokens, which are fast, stateless, simple, and scalable. On the other hand, refresh tokens are used to keep users logged in for longer periods of time, and they can be revoked if a user's access token is compromised.
